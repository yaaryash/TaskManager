# Task Manager Application

## Overview
The **Task Manager** is a full-stack application built to help users manage tasks. It features user authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, and filtering by task status. The frontend is built with **React**, while the backend uses **Node.js** and **MongoDB**. The frontend is deployed on **AWS EC2**, and **NGINX** is configured to serve the app and proxy backend API requests. **PM2** is used to ensure 24/7 backend uptime.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React-based UI for task management
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express handling API requests
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) used to store users and tasks
- **Deployment**: AWS for frontend, NGINX for reverse proxying API requests

## Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with email and password
- **Task Management**: 
  - Create tasks with title, description, priority, and status
  - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
  - Delete tasks

## Data Structure
Each task consists of:
- **id**: Unique identifier (generated by MongoDB)
- **title**: Title of the task (string)
- **description**: Description of the task (string)
- **status**: Task status (complete or incomplete)
- **priority**: Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
- **createdAt**: Timestamp for task creation
- **userId**: ID of the user who created the task (MongoDB ObjectId)

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- Built using **React** (Functional components and React Hooks)
- **Axios** is used for API calls
- State management via React's built-in hooks
- Basic CSS styling applied using [insert styling method, e.g., CSS modules, Styled-components, or Tailwind CSS]

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express** for the server
- **JWT** authentication for securing user login and registration
- RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for tasks and users
- Error handling for API requests and responses
- **MongoDB** is used for storing tasks and user data

## Database
- **MongoDB** is used as the NoSQL database for storing users and tasks
  - **User Schema**: Stores user information (email, password)
  - **Task Schema**: Stores task information (title, description, status, priority, userId)

## Deployment
- **Frontend** is deployed on **AWS EC2**
- **Backend API** is hosted behind **NGINX**, which serves the React app and proxies requests to the backend server
- **Environment Variables**: In this case, environment variables were not used for deployment, and configuration values (such as MongoDB connection string and JWT secret) were hardcoded into the code during deployment.

## Custom Hook
A custom hook is used for handling API requests and/or managing task data.
