# Task Manager Application

## Overview
The **Task Manager** is a full-stack application built to help users manage tasks. It features user authentication, CRUD operations for task. The frontend is built with **React**, while the backend uses **Node.js** and **MongoDB**. The frontend is deployed on **AWS EC2**, and **NGINX** is configured to serve the app and proxy backend API requests. **PM2** is used to ensure 24/7 backend uptime.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React-based UI for task management
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express handling API requests
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) used to store users and tasks
- **Deployment**: AWS for frontend, NGINX for reverse proxying API requests

## Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with email and password
- **Task Management**: 
  - Create tasks with title, description, priority, and status
  - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
  - Delete tasks

## Data Structure
Each task consists of:
- **id**: Unique identifier (generated by MongoDB)
- **title**: Title of the task (string)
- **description**: Description of the task (string)
- **status**: Task status (complete or incomplete)
- **priority**: Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
- **createdAt**: Timestamp for task creation
- **userId**: ID of the user who created the task (MongoDB ObjectId)

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- Built using **React** (Functional components and React Hooks)
- **Axios** is used for API calls
- State management via Redux, React's built-in hooks

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express** for the server
- **JWT** authentication for securing user login and registration
- RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for tasks and users
- Error handling for API requests and responses
- **MongoDB** is used for storing tasks and user data

## Database
- **MongoDB** is used as the NoSQL database for storing users and tasks
  - **User Schema**: Stores user information (name, email, password)
  - **Task Schema**: Stores task information (title, description, status, priority, userId)

## Deployment
- **Frontend** is deployed on **AWS EC2**
- **Backend API** is hosted behind **NGINX**, which serves the React app and proxies requests to the backend server
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values such as the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret are securely managed using environment variables during deployment. These values are not hardcoded into the codebase.

## Custom Hook
A custom hook is used for handling API requests and/or managing task data.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [ https://github.com/yaaryash/TaskManager.git] (https://github.com/yaaryash/TaskManager.git)
cd TaskManager
2. Install frontend dependencies:
3. Start the frontend development server: npm run start
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup
1. Install backend dependencies:
2. MongoDB configuration is not hardcoded in the backend code
- **MongoDB URI**: Replace with your database URI (because it was git ignored and added during deployment)
- **JWT secret key**: Replace with your secret key

3. Start the backend server: npm run dev
The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Running the Application Locally
To run the full-stack application locally:
1. Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
2. Open the frontend in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`), and the backend should automatically handle API requests.

## Database Schema

### User Collection
- **id**: Unique identifier (generated by MongoDB)
- **name**: User's name 
- **email**: User's email address (unique)
- **password**: Hashed password
- **createdAt**: Timestamp of user creation

### Task Collection
- **id**: Unique identifier for each task (generated by MongoDB)
- **title**: Title of the task
- **description**: Description of the task
- **status**: complete or incomplete
- **priority**: Low, Medium, High
- **createdAt**: Timestamp of task creation
- **userId**: User ID (MongoDB ObjectId, foreign key linking to the User collection)

## Seed Data
The database includes seed data for testing. Here are examples of test users and tasks:
- **Users**:
- `jett@gmail.com` (password: `jett@123`)

- **Tasks**:
- Task 1: Finalize Project Report (High Priority)
- Task 2: Team Meeting Preparation (Medium Priority)
- Task 3: Code Cleanup (Low Priority)

## Conclusion
This **Task Manager** application is a full-stack project demonstrating effective task management using **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT** authentication. The application is deployed on **AWS** with **NGINX** handling the reverse proxy for the backend API.
